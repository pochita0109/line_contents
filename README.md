Text_contents

Line Writer

Write a method in python to write multiple line of text contents into a text file mylife.txt.

Process:
1. Open a txt file named and you should append it so that the succeeding lines that the user will input doesn't affect the first line.
2. Ask the user to input a line by creating an input function.
3. Write the line that the user have been entered.
4. Create a condition wherein the program will ask the user if they want to continue or not.
   If yes: They will be asked again by the program to enter another line.
   if no: The program will stop on asking question.
   If other keys: It will print "Invalid Answer" and will ask the user again if they want to continue entering lines.
5. The lines will be stored in mylife.txt.

If you run the program, you will be asked to enter a line. After entering it, the user will be asked by the program again if they want to continue entering lines or not. The lines entered by the user will go to myfile.txt
